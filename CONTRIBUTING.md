# Contributing

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.
However, please conform to the following guidelines when possible:

## Bugs and feature requests?
Before reporting a new issue, try to find an existing issue if one already exists. If it already exists, upvote (üëç) it. Also, consider adding a comment with your unique scenarios and requirements related to that issue.  Upvotes and clear details on the issue's impact help us prioritize the most important issues to be worked on sooner rather than later. If you can't find one, that's okay, we'd rather get a duplicate report than none.

## Pull Requests
Before opening a new pull request, discuss with the community on Github issues.
You just need to follow the instructions in the Pull Request Template for it to be valid.

## Semantic Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). When
writing changes to this project, it is recommended to write changes
that are SemVer compliant with the latest version of the library in
development.

The working release should be the latest build off of the `dev` branch,
but can also be found on the [development board](https://github.com/NextAudio/NextAudio/projects/1).

We follow the .NET Foundation's [Breaking Change Rules](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/breaking-change-rules.md)
when determining the SemVer compliance of a change.

Obsoleting a method is considered a **minor** increment.

## Coding Style

We attempt to conform to the .NET Foundation's [Coding Style](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md)
where possible.

As a general rule, follow the coding style already set in the file you
are editing, or look at a similar file if you are adding a new one.
